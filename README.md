# Bubble-Game
The Bubble Game project is a fun web game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Colorful bubbles are displayed on the screen, and players can clear them by clicking on the bubble with the number which is shown in the Hit column. HTML sets up the game, CSS makes the bubbles visually appealing, and JavaScript adds interactivity by detecting clicks and making bubbles disappear when matched. This project demonstrates how these technologies can combine to create an enjoyable game that you can play directly in your web browser.

## Features
1. Timer set to 60 seconds
2. The score increases by 10 points for clicking on the correct bubble
3. All bubbles reset when a correct bubble is clicked
4. The hit counter resets when all bubbles are reset
5. Game over message displayed when the timer expires

## My Learning In This Project 
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop an interactive Bubble Game. I learned how to create dynamic elements, implement a timer, track scores, and manage user interactions. This hands-on project enhanced my understanding of front-end web development and honed my problem-solving skills as I tackled gameplay logic and interface design challenges. Overall, the project provided an engaging platform for me to apply and reinforce my coding skills in a creative and enjoyable way.

## Future Scope
1. Play with Friends: Make the game multiplayer so friends can play together online, adding more fun.
2. Harder Levels: Create tougher game levels with faster timers and trickier bubble arrangements, giving players more challenges.
3. Game on the Go: Turn the game into a phone app, letting people enjoy it on their mobiles and tablets easily.
